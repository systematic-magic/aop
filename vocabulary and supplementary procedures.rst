Sentence case
	Sentence case is the conventional way of using capital letters in a sentence. That is, you only capitalise the first letter of the  first word – like you would in a sentence. Proper nouns (including abbreviations, gene names, journal titles, scientific databases, etc.) have initial capitals as well.

	E.g. `The cat sat on the mat.` `London is a capital of The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.`
