14. References
--------------
Rererences checks are quite complex due to high number of possible variations. Therfore we have split reference checks into two parts:

| Author list
| Citation data - in-house journals
| Citation data - other journals
| Garbage

14a. Author List
=================

Author list is a list of authors in the reference. Author list should always end with period (.).

14a.1. Check the format of author names in the autor list:

	| Lastname INIT (where INIT is initials of the author, no more than 4 letters)
	|
	| `Examples:`
	| Rini B
	| Escudier BI
	| Loo SCJ
	| Wang KHCN

	| Please note that last names can be compound, can have prepositions, suffixes, prefixes or be mononyms. For example:
	|
	| Compound last names: Garcia-Closas, Gomez Jimenez
	| Last name related prepositions: Van den Brandt, van der Ent
	| Suffixes: Williams 3rd, Rowland Jr
	| Prefixes: McCann, O'Kelly
	| Mononym: Govindjee


	- Check that initials have no more than 4 letters and have **no** hyphens or spaces in-between.

	- Check that mononym (names which have no initials) is “true” mononym, rather being Lasname with missed initials. Check PubMed site, if in doubt.

14a.2. Check the format of author list:

	| exactly 13 authors, et al.
	|
	| exactly 13 authors, et al, Group Authorship 
	|	(comma as a separator between et al and Group Authorship)
	| exactly 13 authors, et al; Group Authorship 
	|	(semicolon as a separator between et al and Group Authorship)

		:alt: Number of authors

	.. image:: /_static/html_group_authorship1.png
		:alt: Group Authorship

	.. image:: /_static/html_group_authorship3.png
		:alt: Group Authorship

	| OR
	|
	| less or equal to 14 authors.
	|
	| less or equal to 14 authors, Group Authorship
	|	(comma as a separator between author list and Group Authorship) 
	| less or equal to 14 authors; Group Authorship 
	|	(semicolon as a separator between author list and Group Authorship)


	.. image:: /_static/html_author_etal_number.png
		:alt: Number of authors

	.. image:: /_static/html_group_authorship2.png
		:alt: Group Authorship


	.. image:: /_static/html_group_authorship4.png
		:alt: Group Authorship


	There can be "and" before Group Authorship (though it is optional). In both cases (with or without "and") there should be a separator (comma or semicolon) before "and".

	- Check that Group Authorship is positioned at the end of author list. Other positions are not allowed.

	- Check that there is a period (.) either after the last author name (if there are less or equal to 14 authors), or after et al (if there are exactly 13 authors + et al), or after Group Authorship (if present).

	- Author list should be formated as plain text.


14b. Citation Data (in-house)
=============================

.. ATTENTION::
	
	This section is applicable ONLY to in-house journals: **Oncotarget, Oncoscience, Aging (Albany NY), Genes Cancer**.

Citation data is a part of a reference, which contains Jounal Name, year, volume, pages and DOI.


14b.1. Check that citation data has correct name of the journal:

	| Oncotarget
	| Oncoscience 
	| Aging (Albany NY)
	| Genes Cancer

	This is the only acceptable spelling. No variations are allowed.

14b.2. Check that citation data has the following format:
