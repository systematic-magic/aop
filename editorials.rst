1.4. Check that following Latin terms are written in italics: *in vivo, in vitro, in utero, in situ, via*. 
For other Latin terms and gene names either italics or :ref:`plain text<plain_text>` is acceptable.

1.5. Check that PDF title matches HTML title.


2. Author List
--------------

8.2.3. Check the format of each element:

	+ Journal title should be followed by period (.). There should be a space after period.

	+ Year should be presented in full (4 digits) and should be followed by semicolon (;). There can be a space after semicolon (but this is not mandatory).

	+ Volume should be one or more digits and should be followed by colon (:). There can be a space after colon (but this is not mandatory).

	+ DOI should be present and it should not contain spaces. There are 2 allowed formats of doi:

		| https://doi.org/ ... (e.g. https://doi.org/10.18632/oncoscience.292.)
		| doi: ... (e.g. doi: 10.1177/1947601910396213.)

	+ DOI shoud should be hyperlinked (or just underlined) if in https://doi.org/ format.

	+ DOI can be followed by period (but this is not mandatory).

	If doi is missing, then you should chose doi format for corrections based on the format of other doi present in the article. I.e. the format of doi should be consistent across all the references in the article.
