We suggest the you use the :ref:`following procedure<correct_case_check>`, if in you are in doubt regarding this or that term.

1.4. Check that following Latin terms are written in italics: *in vivo, in vitro, in utero, in situ, via*. 
For other Latin terms and gene names either italics or :ref:`plain text<plain_text>` is acceptable.

1.5. Check that PDF title matches HTML title.


2. Author List
--------------

2.1. Check that all author names in author list are separated by commas (,). Last two author names in the list can be separated by "and" instead of comma (,). No other separators allowed.

2.2. Check that there is no period (or any other punctuation mark) after the last author name.

   :scale: 40%


2.3. Check the format of the author name. 

Allowed formats:

	+  :sample:`FirstName LastName`
	+  :sample:`FirstName MN. LastName` (MN. are initials of middle names; up to 4 letters)
	+  :sample:`FirstName M.N. LastName` (M.N. are initials of middle names; up to 4 letters)
	+  :sample:`F. MiddleName LastName` (F. is an initial of first name)
	+  :sample:`F. MiddleName MiddleName LastName` (F. is initial of first name and there can any number of middle names)

Please note that last names can be compound, can have prepositions, suffixes, prefixes or be :ref:`mononyms<mononym>`. For example:

	- Compound last names: :sample:`Garcia-Closas, Gomez Jimenez`
	- Last name related prepositions: :sample:`Van den Brandt, van der Ent`
	- Suffixes: :sample:`Williams 3rd, Rowland Jr`
	- Prefixes: :sample:`McCann, O'Kelly`
	- Mononym: :sample:`Govindjee`


.. Important::
	
	LastName **cannot** be presented as initial (even if authors insist on this). LastName should always be presented in full.


If you see that author name does not comply to these standards, please contact corresponding author and ask to provide author name in correct format.

2.4. Check that author names in PDF match author names in HTML.

	   :scale: 60%	


4.2. Check the format of the affiliation text. Authors are free to provide affiliation texts having any elements (e.g. University, School, Department, Lab, Hospital, etc) in any sequence they like. However certain rules apply to affiliation texts:

	- Check that affiliation text contains at least department/division/lab/school and institution.
	| Note that there can be affiliations for non-academic institutions (such as companies). In such cases, "institution" part of affilation text should contain just a company name.
	
	- Check that NO street addresses and house numbers are included in affiliation texts.

	- Check that both country and city names are present in affiliation texts.

9. Reference Callouts
----------------------

9.1. Check reference callouts in the text:

	- Check the format of reference callouts:

	| :sample:`[N]` (where N is the order number of the corresponding reference)
	|
	| `Examples:`
	| :sample:`[1]`
	| :sample:`[1, 2]`
	| :sample:`[1–3]`
	| :sample:`[1, 3–4]`

	.. image:: /_static/editor_callouts.png
		:alt: Callouts
		:scale: 40%
	|
	- Check that only comma (,) and :ref:`en dash<en_dash>` (-) are used as a separators. No other separators are allowed. 

	- Check that there is a space after comma (,) and no space before and after en dash (-).

	- Check that reference callouts are in :ref:`plain text<plain_text>`.

9.2. Check that callout number for each of the references is present in the text or is covered in the range of numbers. I.e. in the range of [1-3] reference 2 is not present in the text, but covered in the range. This is acceptable case.

9.3. Check that there are no "orphaned" callouts (i.e. callout numbers for the references which do not exist). E.g. if you see callout [50] and there are only 40 references in the article, then callout [50] is "orphaned" and should be removed.


10. Figures
-----------

There can be just one figure in the Editorial/News paper. If you see more than 2 figures, please check with Priduction Team.


10.1. Check that figure image has text and graphics which are clear and large enough to read (i.e. image text is not smaller than article text itself).

If image is hard to read, please contact Production team and ask to provide more clear images. If Production team does not have better images, then contact corresponding author.

10.2. Check whether figure has :ref:`panel letters<figure_pannel>`. Both lower case and upper case :ref:`panel letters<figure_pannel>` are allowed. However, they should be used consistently: either all figure panels have lower case letters or all have upper case letters. Mix of formats is not allowed.

10.3. Check the figure description text (figure legend):

	- Check that figure legend has a figure number:

	|	:sampleb:`Figure N:` (where N is a number of the figure)

	- Check that number is followed by colon (:).

	- Check that figure number is formatted in bold and coloured in black.

	- If figure number is followed by text, then check that the first sentence of that text is formatted in bold and coloured in black. The rest of the text should be in plain text.

	|	:sampleb:`Figure 1: First sentence of legend text in sentence case.` :sample:`Second sentance and rest of text.`
	
	.. image:: /_static/html_figure_number.png
   	  	:alt: Figure number
   	  	:scale: 99%

	`Exclusion:` if first sentence contains :ref:`pannel letters<figure_pannel>`, then it should be formatted in plain text.

	|	:sampleb:`Figure 2:` :sample:`First sentence of legend text containing panel letter (`:sampleb:`A`:sample:`) and letter (`:sampleb:`B`:sample:`) in a sentence case. Second sentance and rest of text.`


	.. image:: /_static/html_figure_number_exception.png
   	  	:alt: Figure number
   	  	:scale: 99%

	- If figure image has :ref:`panel letters<figure_pannel>`, then check that reference to each panel is present in figure legend. Reference is denoted by :ref:`panel letter<figure_pannel>` and is formatted in bold.

	| There are 2 allowed formats for the panel reference (case of letter should match letter case in figure image):

	|	:sampleb:`A.` or :sampleb:`a.` - i.e. letter followed by period (.)
	|	:sample:`(`:sampleb:`A`:sample:`)` or :sample:`(`:sampleb:`a`:sample:`)` - i.e. letter wrapped in round brackets ()

	| Panel letters can be combined in different ways in the figure legend text:

	| :sampleb:`A.` :sample:`and` :sampleb:`B.`

	.. image:: /_static/html_fig_reference_anb.png

   	  	:scale: 99%

	| Same variations are allowed for lower case panel letters.


	If a reference to :ref:`panel letter<figure_pannel>` is missing, then please ask author to provide one.


10.4. Check that figure numbers are assigned to figures continuously and there are no gaps in a sequence. In other words there should be no situation when there are figures 1, 3 and 4 in the article, but figure 2 is missing.

At the same time, upon authors request, figures can appear in the text in any order. E.g. figure 2 before figure 1 is OK.

If you see that there are gaps in number sequence, then check with corresponding author whether some figures are missing or whether it is possible to re-number the figures to eliminate the gaps.

10.5. Check figure callouts in the text:

	- Check the format of figure callouts:

	| :sample:`Figure 1`

	.. image:: /_static/editor_figure_callouts_in_text.png
   	  	:alt: Figure number
   	  	:scale: 50%
    |
	If figure has panels, then callout can have a letter (letter case should be the same as on figure image):

	| :sample:`Figure 1A`
	| :sample:`Figure 1a`

	.. image:: /_static/editor_figure_callout.png
   	  	:alt: Figure number
   	  	:scale: 50%

   	|
	| `Examples of callout combinations:`
	| :sample:`Figure 1`
	| :sample:`Figure 1A`
	| :sample:`Figure 1B` :sample:`and` :sample:`1C` (note that there is no "s" at the end of "Figure" word)
	| :sample:`Figure 1B`:sample:`,` :sample:`1C`
	| :sample:`Figure 1B`:sample:`–`:sample:`1C`


	- Check that figure has at least 1 callout in the text. If callouts are missing in the text, please contact author.
