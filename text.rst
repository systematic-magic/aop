10. Text
--------

10.1. Check that there is a period (.) at the end of the abstract text.

10.2. Check MATERIALS AND METHODS section (or its alternatives - see in Section headers) for erroneously placed hyperlinks (e.g. hyperlinked numbers in compound names).

10.3. Check that all website addresses are hyperlinked in article text.


11. Figures
------------

11.1. Check that figure image has text and graphics which are clear and large enough to read (i.e. image text is not smaller than article text itself).

If image is hard to read, please contact Production team and ask to provide more clear images. If Production team does not have better images, then contact corresponding author.

11.2. Check whether figures have pannel letters. Both lower case and upper case pannel letters are allowed. However, they should be used consistently: either all figures have lower case pannel letters or all have upper case letters. Mix of formats is not allowed.

11.3. Check the figure description text (figure legend):

	- Check that figure legend has a figure number:

	|	**Figure N:** (where N is a number of the figure)

	- Check that number is followed by colon (:).

	- Check that figure number is formatted in bold and colored in black.

	- If figure number is followed by text, then check that the first sentence of that text is formatted in bold and colored in black. The rest of the text should be in plain text.

	|	**Figure 1: First sentence of legend text in sentence case.** Second sentance and rest of text.

	Check exclusion to this rule: if first sentence contains pannel letters, then it should be formatted in plain text.

	|	**Figure 2:** First sentence of legend text containing pannel letter (**A**) and letter (**B**) in a sentence case. Second sentance and rest of text.

	- If figure image has pannel letters, then check that referene to each pannel is present in figure legend. Reference is denoted by pannel letter and is formatted in bold.

	There are 2 allowed formats for the pannel reference (case of letter should match letter case in figure image):

	|	**A.** or **a.** - i.e. letter followed by period (.)
	|	(**A**) or (**a**) - i.e. letter wrapped in round brackets ()

	Pannel letters can be combined in different ways in the figure legend text:

	| **A.** and **B.**
	| **A.**, **B.**
	| **A.-C.**
	| (**A and B**)
	| (**A, B**)
	| (**A-C**)

	Same variations are allowed for lower case panel letters.


11.4. Check that figure numbers are assigned to figures sequentially and there are no gaps in a sequence.

11.5. Check figure callouts in the text:

	- Check the format of figire callouts:

	| Fig. 1
	| Figure 1

	If figure has pannels, than callout can have a letter (letter case should be the same as on figure image):

	| Fig. 1A
	| Fig. 1a
	| Figure 1A
	| Figure 1a

	Both formats (Fig. and Figure) are acceptable. However, they should be used consitently: either all callouts have "Fig." or all callouts have "Figure".

	| `Examples:`
	|
	| Figure 1
	| Figure 3C
	| Figures 3A2 and 3B2
	| Figures 6 and 7
	| Figures 9, 10 and 11
	| Figures 7â€“8

	Same variations are allowed for "Fig."


	- Check that words "Figure" or "Fig." as well as number (and letter) are hyperlinked.

	- Check that each figure has at least 1 callout in the text.

	If one or more callouts are missing in the text, please contact author.


.. Important::

	There is a different format for Supplementary Figures.
	It is described in Supplementary materials check here.
