10. Text
--------

10.1. Check that there is a period (.) at the end of the abstract text.

10.2. Check MATERIALS AND METHODS section (or its alternatives - see in Section headers) for erroneously placed hyperlinks (e.g. hyperlinked numbers in compound names).

10.3. Check that all website addresses are hyperlinked in article text.


11. Figures
-----------

11.1. Check that figure texts/graphics are clear and can easily be read.

If figure is hard to read, please contact Production team and ask to provide more clear images. If Production team does not have better images, then contact corresponding author.

11.2. Check whether figures have pannel letters. Both lower case and upper case pannel letters are allowed. However, they should be used consistently: either all figures have lower case pannel letters or all have upper case letters. Mix of formats is not allowed.


11.3. Check the format of figure number and title. The title should be a single sentence (i.e. it is not allowed to have 2 or more sentances as a title). Figure number is mandatory and figure title is optional.
	
	- Check that number and title has the following format:

	|	**Figure N.**
	|	**Figure N: Title text is in sentence case followed by period.** 
	
	|	For example:

	|	**Figure 2.**
	|	**Figure 4: Calibration results.** 

	- Check that title is in sentance case and followed by period.

	- Check that number and title are formatted in bold and colored in black.


11.4. Check the format of figure description text. Description text should be present, if figure has pannels. Otherwise description is optional.

- Check whether figure has pannels:

	+ If there are no pannels, then check that figure description text follows figure number and title. Check that description text is formatted in plain text.

	|
	| `For example:`
	|
	| **Figure 4: Figure title goes here.** This is a figure description in plain text. There can be more than one sentence in a description.

	+ If there are pannels, then there should be description text for each of the pannels. Check that description is formatted in plan text and preceeded by pannel letter. There are 2 allowed formats for pannel letter:
	|
	|	**A.** or **a.**
	|	(**A**) or (**a**)

		- Check that letter case is the same as depicted on figure image. 

		- Check that pannel letter is formatted in bold and colored in black.

	| `Examples:`
	|
	| **Figure 2: RPPA data and model pathways.** **A.** RPPA data proteins. **B.** Protein pathways.
	|
	| **Figure 2: Effects of ERβ. A.** and **B.** A protein-based apoptosis array.
	|
	| **Figure 3: Radiographies of a 43-year old male patient.** Tumors in lungs disappeared. **a.**, **c.** Pre-treatment. **b.**, **d.** Post-treatment.
	|
	| **Figure 4: PLAG inhibited neutrophil infiltration.** **A.-E.**, A’-E’. Articular joints of rear legs.
	|
	| **Figure 2: Effects of LPS/AC treatment on hepatocytes.** (**A**) Variations in hepatocyte viability. (**B**) Effect of different concentrations of LPS/AC treatment.
	| 
	| **Figure 5: Changes in apoptosis rate in chicken.** (**A**) 10 μg/mL CAG treatment group, and (**B, C**) 100 μg/mL CAG treatment group.
	|
	| **Figure 1: Tumor-associated antigen-reactive T cells.** (**A-C**) Cumulative results of IFN-γ ELISpot assays.
	|
	| **Figure 3:** The effects of CAG on (**A**) cell viability, (**B**) alanine transaminase (ALT) activity, and (**C**) aspartate transaminase (AST) activity. 


11.5. Check that figure numbers are assigned to figures sequentially and there are no gaps in a sequence.

11.6. Check figure callouts in the text:

	- Check the format of figire callouts:

	| Fig. 1
	| Figure 1

	If figure has pannels, than callout can have a letter (letter case should be the same as on figure image):

	| Fig. 1A
	| Fig. 1a
	| Figure 1A
	| Figure 1a

	Both formats (Fig. and Figure) are acceptable. However, they should be used consitently: either all callouts have "Fig."" or all callouts have "Figure".

	| `Examples:`
	|
	| Figure 1
	| Figure 3C
	| Figures 3A2 and 3B2
	| Figures 6 and 7
	| Figures 9, 10 and 11
	| Figures 7–8

	| Same combinations with "Fig."


	- Check that words "Figure" or "Fig." as well as number (and letter) are hyperlinked.

	- Check that each figure has at least 1 callout in the text.

	If one or more callouts are missing in the text, please contact author.


.. Important::

	There is a different format for Supplementary Figures.
	It is described in Supplementary materials check here.




11. Figures
------------

11.1. Check that figure image has text and graphics which are clear and large enough to read (i.e. image text is not smaller than article text itself).

If image is hard to read, please contact Production team and ask to provide more clear images. If Production team does not have better images, then contact corresponding author.

11.2. Check whether figures have pannel letters. Both lower case and upper case pannel letters are allowed. However, they should be used consistently: either all figures have lower case pannel letters or all have upper case letters. Mix of formats is not allowed.

11.3. Check the figure description text (figure legend):

	- Check that figure legend has a figure number:

		**Figure N:** (where N is a number of the figure)

	- Check thta number is followed by colon (:).

	- Check that figure number is formatted in bold and colored in black.

	- If figure number is followed by text, then check that the first sentence of that text is formatted in bold and colored in black. The rest of the text should be in plain text.

		**Figure 1: First sentence of legend text in sentence case.**

	Check exclusion to this rule: if first sentence contains pannel letters, then it should be formatted in plain text.

		**Figure 2:** First sentence of legend text containing pannel letter (**A**) and letter (**B**) in a sentence case.

	- If figure image has pannel letters, then check that legend text has a decription of each pannel. Description shoud have a corresponding pannel letter in bold.

	There are 2 allowed formats for the pannel letter in legend text (case of letter should match letter case in figure image):
	|
	|	**A.** - i.e. letter followed by period (.)
	|	(**A**) - i.e. letter wrapped in round brackets ()

	| or if image pannel has letters in lower case:
	|
	| **a.**
	| (**a**)
