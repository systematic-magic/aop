10. Text
--------

10.1. Check that there is a period (.) at the end of the abstract text.

10.2. Check MATERIALS AND METHODS section (or its alternatives - see in Section headers) for erroneously placed hyperlinks (e.g. hyperlinked numbers in compound names).

10.3. Check that all website addresses are hyperlinked in article text.


11. Figures
-----------

11.1. Check that figure texts/graphics are clear and can easily be read.

If figure is hard to read, please contact Production team and ask to provide more clear images. If Production team does not have better images, then contact corresponding author.

11.2. Check whether figures have pannel letters. Both lower case and upper case pannel letters are allowed. However, they should be used consistently: either all figures have lower case pannel letters or all have upper case letters. Mix of formats is not allowed.


11.3. Check the format of figure number and title. The title should be a single sentence (i.e. it is not allowed to have 2 or more sentances as a title). Figure number is mandatory and figure title is optional.
	
	- Check that number and title has the following format:

	|	**Figure N.**
	|	**Figure N: Title text is in sentence case followed by period.** 
	
	|	For example:

	|	**Figure 2.**
	|	**Figure 4: Calibration results.** 

	- Check that title is in sentance case and followed by period.

	- Check that number and title is formatted in bold and colored in black.


11.4. Check the format of figure description text. Description text should be present, if figure has pannels. Otherwise description is optional.

- Check whether figure has pannels:

	+ If there are no pannels, then check that figure description text follows figure number and title. Check that description text is formatted in plain text.

	|
	| `For example:`
	|
	| **Figure 4: Calibration results.** Heat map of the difference of s-OS MIRI and l-OS MIRI for all the proteins and parameters after calibration.

	+ If there are pannels, then there should be description text for each of the pannels. Check that description is formatted in plan text and preceeded by pannel letter. There are 2 allowed standards for pannel letter:
	|
	|	**A.** or **a.*** 
	|	(**A**) or (**a**)

		~ Check that letter case is the same as depicted on figure image,

		~ Check that pannel letter is formatted in bold and colored in black.

	| `Allowed options:`
	|
	| **Figure 2: RPPA data and model pathways.** **A.** RPPA data proteins ratio of s-OS patient vs l-OS patient. **B.** Protein pathways used in the computational analysis: violet nodes are new nodes added to the previous model using RPPA data.
	|
	| **Figure 2: Effects of ERβ on Apoptosis of TNBC cells.** **A.** and **B.** A protein-based apoptosis array was used to assess the effects of 1 nM E2 treatment (24 hours) of ERβ expressing MDA-MB-231 cells on the expression levels of multiple pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins. 
	|
	| **Figure 3: Radiographies of a 43-year old male patient.** Tumors in lungs disappeared after 8 cycles of nivolumab. **a.**, **c.** Pre-treatment. **b.**, **d.** Post-treatment.
	|
	| **Figure 4: PLAG inhibited neutrophil infiltration into CIA joints.** **A.-E.**, A’-E’. Articular joints of rear legs from control, untreated CIA, and treated CIA mice were stained with a neutrophil-specific antibody (NIMP-R14). Images were taken at 40× (A-E), and 200× (A’-E’, B’-C’) magnification.

11.5. Check figure numbers to be in sequence and --- gaps.
