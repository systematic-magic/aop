10. Text
--------

10.1. Check that there is a period (.) at the end of the abstract text.

10.2. Check MATERIALS AND METHODS section (or its alternatives - see in Section headers) for erroneously placed hyperlinks (e.g. hyperlinked numbers in compound names).

10.3. Check that all website addresses are hyperlinked in article text.


11. Figures
-----------

11.1. Check that figure texts/graphics are clear and can easily be read.

If figure is hard to read, please contact Production team and ask to provide more clear images. If Production team does not have better images, then contact corresponding author.

11.2. Check whether figures have pannel letters. Both lower case and upper case pannel letters are allowed. However, they should be used consistently: either all figures have lower case pannel letters or all have upper case letters. Mix of formats is not allowed.


11.3. Check the format of figure number and title. The title should be a single sentence (i.e. it is not allowed to have 2 or more sentances as a title). Figure number is mandatory and figure title is optional.
	
	- Check that number and title has the following format:

	|	**Figure N.**
	|	**Figure N: Title text is in sentence case followed by period.** 
	
	|	For example:

	|	**Figure 2.**
	|	**Figure 4: Calibration results.** 

	- Check that title is in sentance case and followed by period.

	- Check that number and title is formatted in bold and colored in black.


11.4. Check the format of figure description text. Description text should be present, if figure has pannels. Otherwise description is optional.

- Check whether figure has pannels:

	+ If there are no pannels, then check that figure description text follows figure number and title. Check that description text is formatted in plain text.

	|
	| `For example:`
	|
	| **Figure 4: Calibration results.** Heat map of the difference of s-OS MIRI and l-OS MIRI for all the proteins and parameters after calibration.

	+ If there are pannels, then there should be description text for each of the pannels. Check that description is formatted in plan text and preceeded by pannel letter. There are 2 allowed standards for pannel letter:
	|
	|	**A.** or **a.**
	|	(**A**) or (**a**)

		~ Check that letter case is the same as depicted on figure image,

		~ Check that pannel letter is formatted in bold and colored in black.

	| `Allowed options:`
	|
	| **Figure 2: RPPA data and model pathways.** **A.** RPPA data proteins. **B.** Protein pathways.
	|
	| **Figure 2: Effects of ERβ. ** **A.** and **B.** A protein-based apoptosis array.
	|
	| **Figure 3: Radiographies of a 43-year old male patient.** Tumors in lungs disappeared. **a.**, **c.** Pre-treatment. **b.**, **d.** Post-treatment.
	|
	| **Figure 4: PLAG inhibited neutrophil infiltration.** **A.-E.**, A’-E’. Articular joints of rear legs.
	|
	| **Figure 2: Effects of LPS/AC treatment on hepatocytes.** (**A**) Variations in hepatocyte viability. (**B**) Effect of different concentrations of LPS/AC treatment.
	| 
	| **Figure 5: Changes in apoptosis rate in chicken.** (**A**) 10 μg/mL CAG treatment group, and (**B, C**) 100 μg/mL CAG treatment group.
	|
	| **Figure 1: Tumor-associated antigen-reactive T cells.** (**B-D**) Cumulative results of IFN-γ ELISpot assays.
	|
	| **Figure 3:** The effects of CAG on (**A**) cell viability, (**B**) alanine transaminase (ALT) activity, and (**C**) aspartate transaminase (AST) activity. 


11.5. Check figure numbers to be in sequence and --- gaps.
