10. Text
--------

10.1. Check that there is a period (.) at the end of the abstract text.

10.2. Check MATERIALS AND METHODS section (or its alternatives - see in Section headers) for erroneously placed hyperlinks (e.g. hyperlinked numbers in compound names).

10.3. Check that all website addresses are hyperlinked in article text.


11. Figures
-----------

11.1. Check that figure texts/graphics are clear and can easily be read.

If figure is very hard to read, please contact Production team and ask to provide more clear images. If Production team does not have better images, then contact corresponding author.

11.2. Check the format of figure tite and description text. Figure title is mandatory. Description text should be present, if figure has pannels. Otherwise description is optional.

		
	- Check that title has the following format:

	|	**Figure N: Description text in sentence case followed by period.** 
	
	|	For example:

	|	**Figure 2: RPPA data and model pathways.**
	|	**Figure 4: Calibration results.** 

	- Check that title is in sentance case and followed by period.

	- Check that title is formatted in bold and colored in black.

	- Check whether figure has pannels:

		+ If there are no pannels, then check that figure description text follows figure title. Check that description text is formatted in plain text and colored in black.

	|	For example:

	|	**Figure 4: Calibration results.** Heat map of the difference of s-OS MIRI and l-OS MIRI for all the proteins and parameters after calibration.

		+ If there are pannels, then there should be description text for each of the pannels. Description text for each of the pannels should be preceeded by pannel letter and period. Pannle letter should be formatted in bold and colored in black.


	|	Allowed options:

	|	**Figure 2: RPPA data and model pathways.** **A.** RPPA data proteins ratio of s-OS patient vs l-OS patient. **B.** Protein     | pathways used in the computational analysis: violet nodes are new nodes added to the previous model [9] using RPPA data.
