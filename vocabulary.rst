.. _sentence_case:

Sentence case
	Sentence case is the conventional way of using capital letters in a sentence. That is, you only capitalise the first letter of the first word – like you would in a sentence. Proper nouns (including abbreviations, gene names, journal titles, scientific databases, etc.) have initial capitals as well.

	| `Examples:`
	| :sample:`The cat sat on the mat.`
	| :sample:`London is a capital of The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.`
	|

.. _title_case:

Title case
	Title case is the conventional way of using capital letters in a sentence. That is, you capitalise all principal words. Articles, conjunctions, and prepositions do not get capital letters unless they start the title.

	| `Examples:`
	| :sample:`Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.`
	| :sample:`Seven Habits of Effective People.`
