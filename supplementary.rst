1.2. Check supplementary figures callouts in the article text:

	- Check the format of the supplementary figures callouts:

	| :sample:`Supplementary Figure 1`

	No other options are allowed.

	If figure has pannels, then callout can have a letter (letter case should be the same as on figure image):

	| :sample:`Supplementarty Figure 1A`

	| `Examples of callout combinations:`
	| :sample:`Figure 1`
	| :sample:`Figure 3C`
	| :sample:`Figure 2B` :sample:`and` :sample:`2C` (note that there is no "s" at the end of "Figure" word)
	| :sample:`Figure 5B`:sample:`,` :sample:`5C`
	| :sample:`Figure 1E`:sample:`–`:sample:`1G`

	- Check that Supplementary figure collouts are formatted in :ref:`plain text<plain_text>`.

	- 


Supplementary Figure 1

11.5. Check figure callouts in the text:

	- Check the format of figire callouts:

	| :sampleu:`Fig. 1`
	| :sampleu:`Figure 1`


	.. image:: /_static/html_fig_callouts.png
   	  	:alt: Figure number
   	  	:scale: 99%
    |
	If figure has pannels, then callout can have a letter (letter case should be the same as on figure image):

	| :sampleu:`Fig. 1A` 	
	| :sampleu:`Fig. 1a`
	
	.. image:: /_static/html_fig_callout_short_letters.png
   	  	:alt: Figure number
   	  	:scale: 99%
   	|
	| :sampleu:`Figure 1A`
	| :sampleu:`Figure 1a`

	.. image:: /_static/html_fig_callout_full_letters.png
   	  	:alt: Figure number
   	  	:scale: 99%
   	|
	Both formats (Fig. and Figure) are acceptable. However, they should be used consitently: either all callouts have "Fig." or all callouts have "Figure".

	| `Examples of callout combinations:`
	| :sampleu:`Figure 1`
	| :sampleu:`Figure 3C`
	| :sampleu:`Figure 2B` :sample:`and` :sampleu:`2C` (note that there is no "s" at the end of "Figure" word)
	| :sampleu:`Figure 5B`:sample:`,` :sampleu:`5C`
	| :sampleu:`Figure 1E`:sample:`–`:sampleu:`1G`

	.. image:: /_static/html_fig_callout_variations.png
   	  	:alt: Figure number
   	  	:scale: 99%

	Same variations are allowed for "Fig."


	- Check that words "Figure" or "Fig." as well as number (and letter) are hyperlinked.

	- Check that each figure has at least 1 callout in the text.

	If one or more callouts are missing in the text, please contact author.
