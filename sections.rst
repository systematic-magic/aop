9. Section headers
------------------

Section headers should comply to below mentioned requirements in respect of order, letter case, color and spelling. Also, no variations (except for alternatives explicitly mentioned in these standards) are allowed. For example, standards have "Author contributions" section with no alternatives specified, which means that all other variations (like "Authors' contributions, Author contribution, Contribution of author, etc") are not allowed.

If you see any diviations of section naming in articles, please contact authors and check whether they agree to change section header in question in accordance with these standards.


9.1. Check that article has the following sections in the following order:

JUMP TO:

|	:ref:`Research papers (as well as Special Section Research papers<research_papers>`
|	:ref:`Clinical Research papers and Meta-Analysis<clinical_research_papers>`
|	:ref:`Reviews<reviews>`
|	:ref:`Editorials and News<editorials_news>`
|	:ref:`Case reports<case_reports>`
|	:ref:`Research perspectives and Meeting reports<research_perspectives>`
