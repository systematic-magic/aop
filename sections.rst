9. Section headers
------------------

Section headers should comply to below mentioned requirements in respect of order, letter case, color and spelling. Also, no variations (except for alternatives explicitly mentioned in these standards) are allowed.

If you see any diviations of section naming in articles, please contact authors and check whether they agree to change section header in question in accordance with these standards.
